                <p>I was commissioned by a private company to develop a software and  custom hardware to implement it. The device was
                engineered to conduct 24/7 monitoring on MRI machines' statuses. The device itself was a <strong>modified Rasberry Pi</strong> optimized for the workplace environment.
                The software itself was a <strong>Python script</strong> with a <strong>Dropbox API</strong> to allow for the software to store the data locally and on the cloud.
                With the new hardware and software, the company was able to <strong>save $100 per month</strong> compared to their legacy system.

                <p>I was a private home tutor for a middle school student. I was responsible with guiding her through school work and
                    progressing her core understandings of her school subjects. With my efforts, I was able to boost her grade from a C to a B within the first few months of instructions.
