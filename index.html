                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Tung's internet cave! I'm currently a 4th year studying Informatics with a specialization in Organizations and Information Technology. I'm estimated to graduate from UCI in June 2022.</p>
                <img src="ucilogo.png" alt="Uci Logo Picture">
                <p>I'm currently working as an ETL developer intern for UCI OIT and have been for the past 3 months. My goal is to eventually become a project manager for an influential corporation that strives to better society.  I thrive the most in team environments and find the most enjoyment when I am in one. To eventually reach the position I want, I've completed several team projects under the project manager role to get a better understanding of it and prepare myself for my work in the future. Needless to say, I have also stepped down from the leadership role to be an ordinary team member in order to better understand all perspectives of the dynamic and get a better sense of the people I will want to lead in the future.
                </p>

                <p>In my free time I participate in several hobbies including collecting and other forms of entertainment. I tend to collect high-end figures and statues and bespoke custom mechanical keyboards. When Iâ€™m sitting at my desk I'm usually gaming, listening to music, or just kicking back and watching streamers to relax.
